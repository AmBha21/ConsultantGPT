# ConsultantGPT
## **Introduction**  
This document aims to describe the product we are going to create at the Google Hackathon and  the project requirements.

## **Product Requirements**    
We will be pursuing the individual developers track. The requirements for this project are either to revamp your way of doing business and/or build something that can be used by many different types of manufacturing organizations or businesses. Using AI tools and appsheets is preferable.  

## **Product Description**   
Based on the requirements, the product we hope to create an AI agent that can give businesses consulting advice. The user will input a business related prompt with the intent of optimizing their business's performance. Our product will take the prompt and recursively break the prompt into prompts that ChatGPT can answer. The answers ChatGPT returns will "bubble" up into a single output.
